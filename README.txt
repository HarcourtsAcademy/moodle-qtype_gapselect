Gap-select question type

This question type allows students to complete a paragraph of text by selecting the
missing words using drop-down menus. You can make questions like this using the
Cloze question type, but this question type is easier for teachers to get up, and
presents the feedback in a more accessible way.

The question type was created by Jamie Pratt (http://jamiep.org/) paid for by
the Open University (http://www.open.ac.uk/).
